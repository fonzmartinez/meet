# meet

OBJECTIVE
To build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google
Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

FEATURES
Users shouuld be able to: 
● Filter events by city so that user can see the list of events that take place in that city.
● Show/hide event details so that user can see more/less information about an event.
● Specify the number of events user want to view in the app so that user can see more or fewer events in the events list at once.
● Use the app when offline so that user can see the events viewed the last time they were online.
● Add the app shortcut to home screen so that user can open the app faster.
● See a chart showing the upcoming events in each city so that user knows what events are organized in which city.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
App will be a React application built using the TDD technique.

SERVERLESS FUNCTIONS
The meet app will be using serverless functions for authorization. A consumer key and consumer secret will be cross-reference by the authorization server.  If matching, the server will send back a token to identify the user.
